## Preparation & Run

This code has been tested under macOS Big Sur 11.2.3 using Python 3.8.8. Use the following command to install the requirements.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Put the data in `data/` folder with name `edges.csv` and `ground_truth.csv`. Then execute the main program using the following scripts.

```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

The result will be stored in `data/labels.csv`.

**Note**. If you meet with problems running my program, you can send me an email, or find me through Wechat group.
