# EE359-Labs

This is a repository for labs of EE359: Data Mining Techniques in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Currently, two labs are completed, which are

- Lab 1: clustering
- Lab 2: community detection

## Lab 1: Clustering

Kaggle competition is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/datamining-2021.

We mainly implement K-Means Algorithm in the clustering lab.

## Lab 2: Community Detection

Kaggle competition is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/datamining-2021-2.

We mainly implement Louvain Algorithm and Leiden Algorithm in the community detection lab.
